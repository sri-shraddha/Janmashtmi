        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Story of Little Krishna</h1>

        <p>Janmashtami, a joyous celebration observed throughout India, marks the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, the preserver god in the Hindu trinity. The story behind this festival is steeped in mythology and embodies themes of good versus evil, love, and destiny.</p>

        <h2>The Shadow of Kansa</h2>
        <p>The tale begins in Mathura, a kingdom ruled by the tyrannical King Kansa. Kansa, power-hungry and cruel, lived in fear of a prophecy. A divine voice had declared that his own sister Devaki's eighth child would be his downfall. Consumed by paranoia, Kansa imprisoned Devaki and her husband Vasudev, determined to eliminate any threat to his throne.</p>
            
        <h2> A Divine Birth</h2>
        <p>Despite Kansa's cruelty, fate had other plans. Devaki miraculously conceived one after another. Each time, Kansa, in his twisted sense of justice, brutally killed the newborn. But when Devaki's eighth pregnancy approached, divine intervention occurred. The unborn child, Krishna, transferred himself from Devaki's womb to that of Rohini, another wife of Vasudev.</p>
            
        <h2>A Stormy Night and a Dangerous Journey</h2>
            
        <p>On a dark, stormy night, Krishna was born in the prison cell. A celestial voice announced his arrival. Fearful for his son's life, Vasudev knew he had to act. With the help of divine powers, the prison doors opened. Guided by a celestial light, Vasudev placed the newborn Krishna in a basket and embarked on a perilous journey across the raging Yamuna River. Miraculously, the waters parted for him, ensuring his safe passage.</p>
            
        <h2>Finding Refuge in Gokul</h2>
        <p>Reaching the other side, Vasudev found refuge in Gokul, a village nestled near the river. There, he entrusted Krishna to Yashoda and Nanda, a kind couple who had just given birth to a baby girl named Balarama. Krishna was raised by them as their own, growing up amidst the love and laughter of Vrindavan's idyllic countryside.</p>
            
        <h2>Janmashtami Celebrations</h2>
        <p>Janmashtami commemorates this momentous birth. Devotees observe a fast, breaking it only after midnight, the traditional time of Krishna's arrival. Temples are adorned with vibrant decorations, and devotees sing devotional bhajans and kirtans.</p>

        <h2>Remembering the Playful Makhan Chor</h2>
        <p>Krishna, as a child, was known for his mischievous pranks, especially his love for butter (makhan).  One popular tradition is Dahi Handi, where an earthen pot filled with curd (dahi) is hung high, mimicking the pranks Krishna played with his friends. Young people form human pyramids to reach and break the pot, mirroring Krishna's playful spirit.</p>
            
       <p>Janmashtami is a celebration of love, hope, and the triumph of good over evil. It is a time for families and communities to come together, sing, dance, and retell the story of the remarkable birth of Lord Krishna, the embodiment of divine playfulness and love.</p>
